# Forex Price Movement Prediction using LSTM

This repository contains Python code that uses LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks to predict the movement of forex prices. The code processes historical price and technical indicator data to train an LSTM model, which then attempts to predict whether the price will go up or down in the future.

## Prerequisites

Before using this code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- ta (Technical Analysis library)
- matplotlib

You can install the required Python packages using:

```bash
pip install tensorflow pandas numpy scikit-learn ta matplotlib
